            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            Welcome to Netraga ("Company", "we", "our", "us"). These Terms of
            Service (“Terms”, “Terms of Service”) govern your use of our web

            Agreements, and agree to be bound of them.

            <br />
            <h3>Purchases</h3>
            If you wish to purchase any product or service made available
            through Service (“Purchase”), you may be asked to supply certain
            information relevant to your Purchase including, without limitation,
            your credit card number, the expiration date of your credit card,
            your billing address, and your shipping information.
            <br />
            <br />
            You represent and warrant that: (i) you have the legal right to use
            any credit card(s) or other payment method(s) in connection with any
            Purchase; and that (ii) the information you supply to us is true,
            correct and complete.
            <br />
            <br />
            We may employ the use of third party services for the purpose of
            facilitating payment and the completion of Purchases. By submitting
            your information, you grant us the right to provide the information
            to these third parties subject to our Privacy Policy.
            <br />
            <br />
            We reserve the right to refuse or cancel your order at any time for
            reasons including but not limited to: product or service
            availability, errors in the description or price of the product or
            service, error in your order or other reasons.
            <br />
            <br />
            We reserve the right to refuse or cancel your order if fraud or an
            unauthorized or illegal transaction is suspected.
            <br />
            <br />
            <h3>Subscriptions</h3>
            Some parts of Service are billed on a subscription basis
            (“Subscription(s)”). You will be billed in advance on a recurring
            and periodic basis (“Billing Cycle”). Billing cycles are set either
            on a monthly or annual basis, depending on the type of subscription
            plan you select when purchasing a Subscription.
            <br />
            <br />
            At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will
            automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you
            cancel it or Netraga (Netraga Pvt. Ltd.) cancels it. You may cancel
            your Subscription renewal either through your online account
            management page or by contacting Netraga (info@netraga.com) customer
            support team.
            <br />
            <br />A valid payment method, including credit card, is required to
            process the payment for your subscription. You shall provide Netraga
            with accurate and complete billing information including full name,
            address, state, zip code, telephone number, and a valid payment
            method information. By submitting such payment information, you
            automatically authorize Netraga to charge all Subscription fees
            incurred through your account to any such payment instruments.
            <br />
            <br />
            Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, Netraga shall
            issue an electronic invoice indicating that you must proceed
            manually, within a certain deadline date, with the full payment
            corresponding to the billing period as indicated on the invoice.
            <br />
            <br />
            <h3>Fee changes</h3>
            Netraga, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify
            Subscription fees for the Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee change
            will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.
            <br />
            <br />
            Netraga will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any
            change in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate
            your Subscription before such change becomes effective.
            <br />
            <br />
            Your continued use of Service after Subscription fee change comes
            into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified
            Subscription fee amount.
            <br />
            <br />
            <h3>Refunds</h3>
            We issue refunds if you are not happy with the purchase within
            thirty (30) days of the original purchase. You shall drop an email
            to Netraga support team at info@netraga.com to request refunds.
            <br />
            <br />
            <h3>Restrictions</h3>
            You should comply with all applicable laws, including without
            limitation, privacy laws, intellectual property laws, anti-spam
            laws, equal opportunity laws and regulatory requirements. You shall
            never use Netraga for performing any illegal activities or
            distribute content that is not owned by you.
            <br />
            <br />
            <h3>Changes to service</h3>
            We reserve the right to withdraw or amend our Service, and any
            service or material we provide via Service, in our sole discretion
            without notice. We will not be liable if for any reason all or any
            part of Service is unavailable at any time or for any period. From
            time to time, we may restrict access to some parts of Service, or
            the entire Service, to users, including registered users.
            <br />
            <br />
            <h3>Amendments to terms</h3>
            We may amend Terms at any time by posting the amended terms on this
            site. It is your responsibility to review these Terms periodically.
            Your continued use of the Platform following the posting of revised
            Terms means that you accept and agree to the changes. You are
            expected to check this page frequently so you are aware of any
            changes, as they are binding on you. By continuing to access or use
            our Service after any revisions become effective, you agree to be
            bound by the revised terms. If you do not agree to the new terms,
            you are no longer authorized to use Service.
            <br />
            <br />
